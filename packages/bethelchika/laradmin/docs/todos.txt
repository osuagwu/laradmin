# [DONE]Pages
# [done]posts
# look again at how notifications are authorised. Make only a user can read her own notification Might need to create notification policy.


# [IS THIS DONE DONE?]Reconfirm password before a user can self delete or deactivate their account etc;[e.g take you user to a separate page with deletion info and request password from this page]. Create a column on users table named re_auth and then write a a middleware that enforces reauthentication without login user off.Store the users intended destination before re_auth was invoked in the users table in a clumn named re_auth_intended_url
# Logout user after self deletion
# check that self deactivated user is reactivated on login.

# Impliment like and dislike functions [might need to leave this to faceboom for now]

# add reason comments and admin Id who disablled a user's account (comments cann be implemented with a 'note' field on users table) 

# Extend permision to include single objects:  [Note it is probaly better to implement this using permission table or a second permission table,.No need to worry about the permission tabl growing too large because not all objects will need explicit access definition]

# [Wil likely caure issues]Unless its neccessary and will not cause issues, replace all occurance of \BethelChika\Laradmin\User to \App\User expecially in policies and in then in \config\auth.php 

# [done]Allow user to change email. Perhaps store the new email in user.temp_email column untill user confirms the new email

# in the users table delete any user that have not confirmed their email after an hour (Admin management task)

# Allow login with any varified email when AuthWithAnyVarifiedEmail=true|false is set to true.

# [DONE]Fix the error during registration; the error is Perhaps because laravel is handling registration and therefore uses \App\User instead of \BethelChika\Laradmin\User. Might need to let Laradmin handle registration.
